<font class="portlet-font">This is a simple showcase of Portal Node Event Listener. For this portal page it ensures
   that in every column, only one portlet window is in <b>NORMAL</b> state. Try to change the window state of other
   portlets and see what happens. To learn more, read <b>InterPortlet Communication (IPC)</b> chapter in
   <b>JBoss Portal Reference Guide.</b>
